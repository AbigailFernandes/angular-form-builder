 * A tranformation applied over the build graph.

 * By design, a pipeable operator over `BuildGraph`.
 *  - A transformation takes a `BuildGraph` as input (from previous transformations).
 *  - A transformation performs some operations based on the graph's data, potentially modifying nodes in the graph.
 *  - It returns a `BuildGraph` that will be passed to subsequent transformations.
